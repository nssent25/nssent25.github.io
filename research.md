# Research Experience

## Astronomical Data Analysis


### Key Research Areas

- **Spectral Analysis**: Developed algorithms to extract and analyze spectral signatures from exoplanetary atmospheres
- **Data Processing**: Created pipelines to process and clean raw JWST data for scientific analysis
- **Visualization**: Designed new visualization techniques for multi-dimensional astronomical datasets

## Machine Learning Applications in Astronomy

My ongoing research combines astronomical data analysis with machine learning techniques to automate the detection and classification of celestial objects.

### Projects

- **Automated Stellar Classification**: Built a convolutional neural network to classify stellar types from spectral data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Developed unsupervised learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns in astronomical datasets
- **Feature Extraction**: Created methods to automatically identify and extract features from astronomical images

## Academic Publications and Presentations

### Publications
- Placeholder for future publications

### Presentations
- Colby College Research Symposium (2023)

## Future Research Directions

I'm interested in continuing research at the intersection of computer science, machine learning, and astronomy, with a focus on:

- Developing more efficient algorithms for processing large astronomical datasets
- Applying deep learning to solve complex astronomical problems
- Creating open-source tools to make astronomical research more accessible
